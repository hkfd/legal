# GDPR: DATA PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CLIENTS AND SUPPLIERS

We, namely, Heckford Printers Limited are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and this means protecting your personal data.

We need your personal data to enable us to work for you. If we cannot use your personal data we will be unable to enter into a contract with you or provide any of our services.

This policy (together with our terms and conditions) sets out the basis upon which any **personal data** that we collect from you or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

**This is an important document, please read it carefully as it sets out how we will use your personal data and protect your privacy.**

The rules on processing of personal data are set out in the General Data Protection Regulations 2018 (the "GDPR").

The GDPR applies to personal data meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier (as explained in Article 6 of GDPR).

We will process your personal data in accordance with the requirements of GDPR. Processing for this purpose means performing any operation or set of operations concerning personal data or sets of personal data of an individual, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

We will use your personal data for the purposes of corporate marketing services including advertising, design and print digital, illustration, 3D, CGI, exhibitions and signage.

Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.

We will process your personal data, namely, your name, email address, company telephone number, IP address, job title, company address.

We have obtained your personal data from you directly and we will process it pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR with your consent and because processing your data is necessary for entering into or the performance of a contract with you as the data subject. In the circumstances, processing your data is necessary to enable us to comply with a legal obligation.

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

We keep your personal data for 6 years in order to meet our legal obligations such as in case of legal claims and complaints.

Unless subject to an exemption under the GDPR, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:

- **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

- **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

- **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

- **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

- **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

  - If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
  - Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
  - Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
  - You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

* **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

* **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We will not transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area.

## FURTHER PROCESSING

If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose, not covered by this Data Privacy Notice, then we will provide you with a new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing the processing and setting out the relevant purposes and processing conditions.
